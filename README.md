My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I started to participate in 2022 while also trying to solve some tasks from past years to learn more about algorithms and programming. Right now all solutions are in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) for this awesome project!
